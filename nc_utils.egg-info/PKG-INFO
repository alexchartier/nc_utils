# Sounder

Sounder is a real-time pulsed radar application that uses software-defined radios (SDRs) to demonstrate ionospheric topside sounding.

This application can be used to synthesize several different pulsed radar waveforms, including phase and frequency-modulated waveforms which are then transmitted via an SDR. The SDR will transmit in a frequency-stepped method to cycle through all available frequencies.

The received samples are then recorded (via Digital RF) and/or analyzed using a pulsed doppler processing algorithm.

## Installation
Install the Python-wrapped C/C++ dependencies:

* digital_rf: https://github.com/MITHaystack/digital_rf
* pyfftw: https://github.com/pyFFTW/pyFFTW
* uhd (tested on v3.15.LTS): https://github.com/EttusResearch/uhd

Install the Python dependencies:
```
$ python3 -m pip install faster_fifo matplotlib numpy scipy
```

Install the package in editable mode:
```
$ python3 -m pip install -e .
```

Use sysctl to adjust the kernel network buffer sizes. This should be added to a script that occurs on reboot for the interface used to connect to the USRPs. Thatâ€™s 50 million for rmem_max and 50 million for wmwem_max.

```
$ sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=50000000
$ sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=50000000
```

Verify that the kernel network buffer sizes are set:
```
$ cat /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max
$ cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max
```


## Running the Tests
Run the unit tests using Pytest (note that the USRP unit test requires a USRP to be connected and turned on):
```
$ pytest
```
If Pytest was installed via apt then run the following command:
```
$ pytest-3
```

## Setup the Configuration File
Some configuration files (*.ini files) are shipped with the program, located inside the `conf` folder. If you wish to create or edit a configuration file, see the Python file `sounder/config.py` for a list of each configurable option and an explanation of what each does.

## Running the Program
Run the program using the following command, replacing <> with the *.ini configuration file desired:
```
$ python3 sounder <path_to_configuration_file.ini>
```
